# Discussion

## Overview of key findings

- Superior performance of Simple1d-E
  - Bar chart with performance on each ISA
-

## Model architecture performance analysis

- Why embeddings work so well
- Why larger models do not perform better
- 1D vs 2D
- Variability ("flakyness") in model performance

## Model generalizability

- LOGO already tests this
  - Show comparison to regular leave-one-out cross validation to prove that it overfits if not using LOGO CV
- Why does this not convert well to CpuRec?
  - Limited sample size
  - Greater diversity of architectures
  - Statistical significance

## Comparision with prior literature

## UN sustainability goals

- Smaller models use less power which is good
