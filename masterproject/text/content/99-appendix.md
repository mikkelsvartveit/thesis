# Dataset additional information

Contains additional information about the datasets used in this thesis. This includes information about the dataset sizes, number of samples, labeling, as well as comparisons with related work.

## BuildCross dataset label list and sizes

<!-- BuildCross Arch_details:
(Files smaller than 1024 bytes are ignored)
(No Samples are counted in 1024 bytes, with filesplitting)
Total Size: 119.88 MB
Average Size per ISA: 3.00 MB
Median Size per ISA: 2.51 MB -->

The BuildCross dataset contains a total of **119.88 MB** of data, with an average size of **3.00 MB** per ISA and a median size of **2.51 MB** per ISA. The dataset is divided into 40 different ISAs, each with a varying number of files and samples. All files smaller than 1024 bytes are ignored.

Table: The list of labels used in the BuildCross dataset. The labels are based on the ELF headers of the generated code and the disassembly of the binaries \label{table:buildcross-labels-full}

# Statistical analysis material

## Confidence interval and comparison implementation

## Pairwise model comparison

Each model in each evaluation strategy is compared to each other using a paried t-test, testing for whether there are statistically significant differences in model performance. The results are shown in the tables below.

### Endianness
