# Statistical analysis material

## Confidence interval and comparison implementation

## Pairwise model comparison

Each model in each testing suite is compared to each other, using a paried t-test. The results are shown in the tables below.

![Significance of compared model performance on the kfold endianness suite. The p-value refer to the probability, given that there is no significant difference between the two models, that we see observe the difference that we have found](images/appendix/model-comparison/model-comparison-kfold-all-endianness.svg)
