## Computer software

### Binary executables

All computer software boils down to a series of bytes readable by the CPU. The bytes are organized in _instructions_. An instruction always includes an _opcode_ (Operation Code), which tells the CPU what operation should be executed. Depending on the opcode, the instruction often contains one or more _operands_, which provides the CPU with the data that should be operated on. The operands can be immediate values (values specified directly in the instruction), registers (a small, very fast memory located physically on the CPU), or memory addresses.
