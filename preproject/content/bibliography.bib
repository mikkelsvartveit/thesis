  abstract = {The computation of elementary functions is required in many tasks of Internet of Things (IoT) endpoint devices, for example, communications, image processing, and biomedical signal processing. IoT endpoint devices generally adopt software approaches to compute elementary functions, which take many cycles. To improve efficiency, this work proposes custom instructions for elementary functions to the open-source RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). In particular, several variants of the custom instructions (fast, intermediate, and tiny variants) are developed to satisfy the needs of various types of IoT devices. Microarchitecture design and VLSI circuit design are then proposed to efficiently support the extended ISA. Both software emulation and on-board evaluation of the new architecture are carried out with testbenches covering typical communication and computation tasks for IoT devices. The custom instructions gain speedups ranging from 3.3 to 18.0 compared to a baseline RV32IM design. ASIC synthesis results under TSMC 28nm technology demonstrate that the power overhead is $ \lt $< 5% with the tiny variant, $ \lt $< 17% with the intermediate variant, and $ \lt $< 26% with the fast variant, which is not significant considering the achieved speedup. The experimental results further confirm that the proposed custom instructions are computation-efficient and versatile to adapt to different IoT devices for various applications.},

The devices accessed with default credentials are getting compromised with brute force attempts or the vulnerable devices are compromised with exploits to install the malware and perform malicious activity like initiating denial of service (DoS) attacks. The malware detection and classification in IoT paradigm is still considered a problem, as the adversary consistently create new variants of IoT malware and actively look for compromising the victim devices. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning (DL) based Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit-Convolutional Neural Network (Bi-GRU-CNN) model to detect the IoT malware and classify the IoT malware families using Executable and Linkable Format (ELF, formerly named Extensible Linking Format) binary file byte sequences as an input feature. In addition, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based DL model combinations are considered to evaluate the performances of the IoT malware detection and family classification and also those models performance is compared with the proposed method. Our performance evaluation shows that our proposed approach obtained 100% accuracy for IoT malware detection case and 98% for IoT malware family classification. Further evaluation of our proposed model with only byte sequence as an input feature exhibit similar performance as the byte sequence and CPU types as an input features and showed that our model is robust and platform independent to detect and classify the IoT malware.}

Due to the exists of many different compilation optimization options, the difference in the contents of the binary file is very complicated. There are thousands of compiler optimization algorithms and multiple different processor architectures, so it is very difficult to manually analyze binary files and recognize its compiler optimization level with rules. This paper first proposes a CNN-based compiler optimization level recognition model: BinEye. The system extracts semantic and structural differences and automatically recognize the compiler optimization levels. The model is designed to be very suitable for binary file processing and is easy to understand. We built a dataset containing 80028 binary files for the model training and testing. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of over 97%. At the same time, BinEye is a fully CNN-based system and it has a faster forward calculation speed, at least 8 times faster than the normal RNN-based model. Through our analysis of the model output, we successfully found the difference in assembly codes caused by the different compiler optimization level. This means that the model we proposed is interpretable. Based on our model, we propose a method to analyze the code differences caused by different compiler optimization levels, which has great guiding significance for analyzing closed source compilers and binary security analysis.},

  abstract = {While compiling a native application, different compiler flags or optimization levels can be configured. This choice depends on the different requirements. For example, if the application binary is intended for final release, the flags and optimization settings should be set for execution speed and efficiency. Alternatively, if the application is to be used for debugging purposes, debug flags should be configured accordingly, usually involving minor or no code optimization. However, this information cannot be easily extracted from a compiled binary. Nonetheless, ensuring the same compiler and compilation flags is particularly important when comparing different binary files, to avoid inaccurate or unreliable analyses. Unfortunately, to understand which flags and optimizations have been used, a deep knowledge of the target architecture and the compiler used is required. In this study, we present two deep learning models used to detect both compiler and optimization level in a compiled binary. The optimization levels we study are O0, O1, O2, O3, and Os in the x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V, SPARC, PowerPC, MIPS, and ARM architectures. In addition, for the x86_64 and AArch64 architectures, we also determine whether the compiler is GCC or Clang. We created a dataset of more than 76000 binaries and used it for training. Our experiments showed over 99.95% accuracy in detecting the compiler and between 92% to 98%, depending on the architecture, in detecting the optimization level. Furthermore, we analyzed the change in accuracy when the amount of data was extremely limited. Our study shows that it is possible to accurately detect both compiler flag settings and optimization levels with function-level granularity.},

One of the major challenges for antimalware industry is the vast amounts of data and files which need to be evaluated for potential malicious content. To effectively analyze such large amounts of files, machine learning based malware classification approaches have been developed to classify malware into families based on the same forms of malicious behaviors. This paper presents our design and implementation of a malware classification approach using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a prime example of deep learning algorithms. It makes use of CNNs to learn a feature hierarchy for classifying samples of malware binary files, represented as gray-scale images, to their corresponding families. It also uses transfer learning techniques to facilitate model building. Three different models of CNNs were developed and these implemented methods achieved validation accuracy around 97% using the large malware dataset provided for the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015).},

Malware developers continually find new ways to circumvent security research’s ongoing efforts to guard against malware attacks. Malware Classification (MC) entails labeling a class of malware to a specific sample, while malware detection merely entails finding malware without identifying which kind of malware it is. There are two main reasons why the most popular MC techniques have a low classification rate. First, Finding and developing accurate features requires highly specialized domain expertise. Second, a data imbalance that makes it challenging to classify and correctly identify malware. Furthermore, the proposed malware classification (MC) method consists of the following five steps: (i) Dataset preparation: 2D malware images are created from the malware binary files; (ii) Visualized Malware Pre-processing: the visual malware images need to be scaled to fit the CNN model’s input size; (iii) Feature extraction: both hand-engineering (Tamura) and deep learning (GoogLeNet) techniques are used to extract the features in this step; (iv) Classification: to perform malware classification, we employed k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The proposed method is tested on a standard Malimg unbalanced dataset. The accuracy rate of the proposed method was extremely high, making it the most efficient option available. The proposed method’s accuracy rate was outperformed both the Hand-crafted feature and Deep Feature techniques, at 95.42 and 96.84 percent.},

Cybersecurity researchers makes continuous efforts to defend against these malware risks. This research aims to exploit the significant advantages of Transfer Learning (TL) and Fine-Tuning (FT) methods to introduce efficient malware detection in the context of imbalanced families without the need to apply complex features extraction or data augmentation processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a visualized malware multi-classification framework to avoid false positives and imbalanced datasets’ challenges through using the fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN)-based TL models. The proposed framework comprises eight different FT CNN models including VGG16, AlexNet, DarkNet-53, DenseNet-201, Inception-V3, Places365-GoogleNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2. First, the binary files of different malware families were transformed into 2D images and then forwarded to the FT CNN models to detect and classify the malware families. The detection and classification performance was examined on a benchmark Malimg imbalanced dataset using different, comprehensive evaluation metrics. The evaluation results prove the FT CNN models’ significance in detecting malware types with high accuracy that reached 99.97% which also outperforms the performance of related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based malware multi-classification approaches tested on the same malware dataset.},

Variants of malicious code are constantly increasing, and their attacks will have a serious impact on the network environment, so effective detection of malicious code has important research significance. However, the current malicious code detection methods still have some problems, such as code detection, cumbersome feature extraction, and misclassification between similar families. To this end, the paper proposes a fine-grained detection method for malicious code. First visualized the binary files of malicious code and converted them into grayscale images. Then, use the improved convolutional neural network to extract the multi-resolution features of grayscale images, and use the interactive fusion method to fuse these features. Finally, input the fused features into the fully connected layer to complete the fine-grained classification of malicious code. Experiments prove that our method is indeed effective for fine-grained classification of malicious code.},

The proposed model does not use the normalized fixed-size square images (e.g. 64 × 64 pixels) or features extracted by image descriptor (e.g. GIST) for training classifiers as existing models do in the literature. Instead, the input images are normalized and horizontally sized down (the width of the image) to a lower dimension of 32 × 64, 16 × 64 or even 8 × 64 than square ones (e.g. 64 × 64 pixels) to reduce the complexity and training time of the model. It is based on the fact that the texture of the malware image is mainly vertically distributed as analysed in this paper. This finding is significant for training those devices which have limited computational resources such as IoT devices. The experiment was conducted on the Malimg, Malheur datasets which contains 9339 (25 malware families) and 3133 variant samples (24 malware families) using k-NN, SVM and CNN classifiers. The achieved results show that it is possible to reduce the dimension of the input images (i.e. 32 × 64, 16 × 64 or even 8 × 64) while still retaining the accuracy of classification as the same as the accuracy obtained by classifier feeding by the fixed-size square image (i.e. 64 × 64 pixels). As a result, training time of the propose model reduces by a half, a quarter, and one-eighth compared to training time taken by the same machine learning-based classifier (i.e. k-NN, SVM and CNN) feeding by fixed-sized square images, i.e. 64 × 64, respectively.}

It is a difficult task to manually thwart an assault by malware. It is crucial to properly categorize malware binaries in order to identify their origins. Furthermore, malware structure discovery through basic feature extraction approaches are time-consuming and challenging. Malware classification was previously solved using naive machine learning approaches like support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Recently, deep learning (DL) has shown to be impactful in finding malicious patterns. Without DL, analysis of the vast amounts of available data tends to impossible. Existing methods (e.g., transfer learning, fusion methodology, ensemble learning) may not be effective on actual malware binary files. Moreover, some single image-based malware classification used rudimentary convolutional neural network (CNN) that does not perform well. Faced with these challenges, we propose in this paper a novel model with of a spatial CNN with sufficient regularization and data augmentation that can identify and classify malware in images effectively and efficiently. Our model is evaluated using datasets like MalImg and Microfsoft-Big. The proposed model achieves validation score of 99.93% for MalImg and 99.72% for Microsoft-Big datasets. Our approach outperforms VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, and Google's Inception v3, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.},

The occurrence and recurrence behavior of these components is determined by the common tasks malware samples in a particular family carry out. Thus, we view a malware binary as a series of emissions generated by an underlying stochastic process and use recurrence plots to transform malware binaries into two-dimensional texture images. We observe that recurrence plot-based malware images have significant visual similarities within the same family and are different from samples in other families. We apply deep CNN classifiers to classify malware samples. The proposed approach does not require creating malware signature or manual feature engineering. Our preliminary experimental results show that the proposed malware representation leads to a higher and more stable accuracy in comparison to directly transforming malware binaries to gray-scale images.},

  abstract   = {The unprecedented growth in mobile systems has transformed the way we approach everyday computing. Unfortunately, the emergence of a sophisticated type of malware known as ransomware poses a great threat to consumers of this technology. Traditional research on mobile malware detection has focused on approaches that rely on analyzing bytecode for uncovering malicious apps. However, cybercriminals can bypass such methods by embedding malware directly in native machine code, making traditional methods inadequate. Another challenge that detection solutions face is scalability. The sheer number of malware variants released every year makes it difficult for solutions to efficiently scale their coverage. To address these concerns, this work presents RansomShield, an energy-efficient solution that leverages CNNs to detect ransomware. We evaluate CNN architectures that have been known to perform well on computer vision tasks and examine their suitability for ransomware detection. We show that systematically converting native instructions from Android apps into images using space-filling curve visualization techniques enable CNNs to reliably detect ransomware with high accuracy. We characterize the robustness of this approach across ARM and x86 architectures and demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution across heterogeneous platforms including smartphones and chromebooks. We evaluate the suitability of different models for mobile systems by comparing their energy demands using different platforms. In addition, we present a CNN introspection framework that determines the important features that are needed for ransomware detection. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of this solution against adversarial machine learning (AML) attacks using state-of-the-art Android malware dataset.},

Classification of malware by their features is necessary for the security of information technology (IT) society. To provide security from malware, deep neural networks (DNN) can offer a superior solution for the detection and categorization of malware samples by using image classification techniques. To strengthen our ideology of malware classification through image recognition, we have experimented by comparing two perspectives of malware classification. The first perspective implements dense neural networks on binary files and the other applies deep layered convolutional neural network on malware images. The proposed model is trained to a set of malware samples, which are further distributed into 9 different families. The dataset of malware samples which is used in this paper is provided by Microsoft for Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge in 2015. The proposed model shows an accuracy of 97.80% on the provided dataset. By using the proposed model optimum classifications results can be attained.},

In addition, malwares continue growing in frequency and sophistication where the identification and classification of the classic and new variants of different malware families is a difficult task that requires modern detection techniques. In this paper, a malware classification method based on two novel local binary pattern descriptors and convolutional neural network, which represents malware binary files as gray-scale images, is presented. The proposed method exploits the fact that most malware variants in the same family have similar local and global structures, therefore, the computing of the local binary descriptors of the gray-scale images facilitates the detection and classification of the variants of a malware. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method outperforms previous related schemes in terms of accuracy resulting in of about 98 %.},

  abstract      = {Malware classification continues to be exceedingly difficult due to the exponential growth in the number and variants of malicious files. It is crucial to classify malicious files based on their intent, activity, and threat to have a robust malware protection and post-attack recovery system in place. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based model, S-DCNN, to classify malware binary files into their respective malware families efficiently. S-DCNN uses the image-based representation of the malware binaries and leverages the concepts of transfer learning and ensemble learning. The model incorporates three deep convolutional neural networks, namely ResNet50, Xception, and EfficientNet-B4. The ensemble technique is used to combine these component models'predictions and a multilayered perceptron is used as a meta classifier. The ensemble technique fuses the diverse knowledge of the component models, resulting in high generalizability and low variance of the S-DCNN. Further, it eliminates the use of feature engineering, reverse engineering, disassembly, and other domain-specific techniques earlier used for malware classification. To establish S-DCNN's robustness and generalizability, the performance of proposed model is evaluated on the Malimg dataset, a dataset collected from VirusShare, and packed malware dataset counterparts of both Malimg and VirusShare datasets. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art 10-fold accuracy of 99.43{\%} on the Malimg dataset and an accuracy of 99.65{\%} on the VirusShare dataset.},

We show that using simple byte-value histograms we retain enough information about the opcodes within a sample to classify the target architecture with high accuracy, and then discuss heuristic-based features that exploit information within the operands to determine endianess.

  abstract          = {Static binary analysis techniques are widely used to reconstruct the behavior and discover vulnerabilities in software when source code is not available. To avoid errors due to mis-interpreting data as machine instructions (or vice-versa), disassemblers and static analysis tools must precisely infer the boundaries between code and data. However, this information is often not readily available. Worse, compilers may embed small chunks of data inside the code section. Most state of the art approaches to separate code and data are rooted on recursive traversal disassembly, with severe limitations when dealing with indirect control instructions. We propose ELISA, a technique to separate code from data and ease the static analysis of executable files. ELISA leverages supervised sequential learning techniques to locate the code section(s) boundaries of header-less binary files, and to predict the instruction boundaries inside the identified code section. As a preliminary step, if the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the binary is unknown, ELISA leverages a logistic regression model to identify the correct ISA from the file content. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on a dataset of executables compiled for different ISAs, and we show that our method is capable to identify code sections with a byte-level accuracy (F1 score) ranging from 98.13% to over 99.9% depending on the ISA. Fine-grained separation of code from embedded data on x86, x86-64 and ARM executables is accomplished with an accuracy of over 99.9%. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

  abstract          = {Binary analysis of software is a critical step in cyber forensics applications such as program vulnerability assessment and malware detection. This involves interpreting instructions executed by software and often necessitates converting the software's binary file data to assembly language. The conversion process requires information about the binary file's target instruction set architecture (ISA). However, ISA information might not be included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial downloads, or adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising methodology that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in the object code section of binary files. In this paper we propose a binary code feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability of ML-based ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the absence of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from natural language processing (NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the significance of each byte pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of encoded binaries to identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We evaluate our approach using two different datasets: binaries from 12 ISAs and 23 ISAs. Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in ML-based ISA identification results in 98% accuracy compared to the 91% accuracy of state-of-the-art features based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that character-level features allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to 16x while maintaining accuracy of ISA identification above 97%.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {When presented with an unknown binary, which may or may not be complete, having the ability to determine information about it is critical to future reverse engineering, particularly in discovering the binary's intended use and potential malicious nature. This paper details techniques to both identify the machine architecture of the binary, as well as to locate the important code segments within the file. This identification of unknown binaries makes use of a technique called byte histogram in addition to various machine learning (ML) techniques, which we call 'What is it Binary' or WiiBin. Benefits of byte histograms reflect the simplicity of calculation and do not rely on file headers or metadata, allowing for acceptable results when only a small portion of the original file is available; e.g., when encrypted and/or compressed sections are present in a binary. Utilizing WiiBin, we were able to accurately (>80%) determine the architecture of test binaries with as little as a 20% contagious portion of the file present. We were also able to determine the location of code sections within a binary by utilizing the WiiBin framework. Ultimately, the more information that can be gleaned from a binary file, the easier it is to successfully reverse engineer.  © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract          = {Static and dynamic binary analysis techniques are actively used to reverse engineer software's behavior and to detect its vulnerabilities, even when only the binary code is available for analysis. To avoid analysis errors due to misreading op-codes for a wrong CPU architecture, these analysis tools must precisely identify the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the object code under analysis. The variety of CPU architectures that modern security and reverse engineering tools must support is ever increasing due to massive proliferation of IoT devices and the diversity of firmware and malware targeting those devices. Recent studies concluded that falsely identifying the binary code's ISA caused alone about 10% of failures of IoT firmware analysis. The state of the art approaches detecting ISA for executable object code look promising, and their results demonstrate effectiveness and high-performance. However, they lack the support of publicly available datasets and toolsets, which makes the evaluation, comparison, and improvement of those techniques, datasets, and machine learning models quite challenging (if not impossible). This paper bridges multiple gaps in the field of automated and precise identification of architecture and endianness of binary files and object code. We develop from scratch the toolset and datasets that are lacking in this research space. As such, we contribute a comprehensive collection of open data, open source, and open API web-services. We also attempt experiment reconstruction and cross-validation of effectiveness, efficiency, and results of the state of the art methods. When training and testing classifiers using solely code-sections from executable binary files, all our classifiers performed equally well achieving over 98% accuracy. The results are consistent and comparable with the current state of the art, hence supports the general validity of the algorithms, features, and approaches suggested in those works. © 2020 ACM.},
