abstract="In this paper, we present the results obtained by applying deep learning techniques to classification of network protocols and applications using flow features and data signatures. We also present a similar classification of malware using their binary files. We use our own dataset for traffic identification and Microsoft Kaggle dataset for malware classification tasks. The current techniques used in network traffic analysis and malware detection is time consuming and beatable as the precise signatures are known. Deep learned features in both cases are not hand crafted and are learned form data signatures. It cannot be understood by the attacker or the malware in order to fake or hide it and hence cannot be bypassed easily.",

abstract = {In the context of the current large number of malicious codes, the detection and protection of malicious codes is particularly important. In recent years, a method of using deep learning to detect malicious code has emerged. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new detection method that converts binary files of malicious code into decimal arrays and use 1-D CNN to perform classification and recognition. Aiming at the imbalance in the number of code families, we choose xgboost, which performs well in the classification prediction competition. We conduct experiments on 9,458 malware samples from 25 different malware families in the Vision Research Lab. The experimental results show that our classification prediction reaches 97\% accuracy.},

abstract = {The number of publicly exposed Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been increasing, as more number of these devices connected to the internet with default settings. The devices accessed with default credentials are getting compromised with brute force attempts or the vulnerable devices are compromised with exploits to install the malware and perform malicious activity like initiating denial of service (DoS) attacks. The malware detection and classification in IoT paradigm is still considered a problem, as the adversary consistently create new variants of IoT malware and actively look for compromising the victim devices. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning (DL) based Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit-Convolutional Neural Network (Bi-GRU-CNN) model to detect the IoT malware and classify the IoT malware families using Executable and Linkable Format (ELF, formerly named Extensible Linking Format) binary file byte sequences as an input feature. In addition, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based DL model combinations are considered to evaluate the performances of the IoT malware detection and family classification and also those models performance is compared with the proposed method. Our performance evaluation shows that our proposed approach obtained 100% accuracy for IoT malware detection case and 98% for IoT malware family classification. Further evaluation of our proposed model with only byte sequence as an input feature exhibit similar performance as the byte sequence and CPU types as an input features and showed that our model is robust and platform independent to detect and classify the IoT malware.}
