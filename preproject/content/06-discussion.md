# Discussion

## Main findings

- Promising input conversion / code representation:
- Standout architectures
- Standout techniques
  - Transfer learning with VGG-16 seems great

## Analysis and interpretation

- Performance metrics imbalance dataset comparison
- How domain specific is malware classificaton
  - Comment on performance being so high on malimg
  - Dataset imbalance? (might just be true for ml in general)

## Research gaps

## Implications (future work, future use)

Practical and thoretical applications of what we have found

## Limitations (of our work, methodology)
