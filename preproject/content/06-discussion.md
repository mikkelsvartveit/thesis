# Discussion

## Main findings

- Promising input conversion / code representation:
- Standout architectures
- Standout techniques
  - Transfer learning with VGG-16 seems great

## Analysis and interpretation

- Performance metrics imbalance dataset comparison
- How domain specific is malware classificaton
  - Comment on performance being so high on malimg
  - Dataset imbalance? (might just be true for ml in general)

## Research gaps

## Implications (future work, future use)

Practical and thoretical applications of what we have found

## Limitations (of our work, methodology)

Notes ml-isa
  - Capturing features (clemens, NLP papers) across multiple bytes when counting require large feature vectors. encoding worked well for n-grams, ie  < 8bit as smallest unit. NLP paper does not have f1 scores, lot of grpahs, but lacks hard numbers for different architectures.
