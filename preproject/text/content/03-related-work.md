Through our search, we have discovered one secondary study related to our work. This survey, carried out by Hawana et al. in 2023, presents an analysis of 10 primary studies that have applied CNN to malware classification tasks using binary programs as the input [@Hawana2023].

They first discuss why CNN is an improvement over traditional signature-based malware detection. Then, they outline how to convert malware binary files into grayscale images, how to use CNN for classifying these images, and how CNN can be leveraged to automatically learn features from raw data. Moreover, they present a literature survey comparing performance across commonly used datasets. They find that state-of-the-art research achieve accuracy above 99% for most of the datasets considered.

However, we note that this review does not seem to be particularly structured. The authors do not disclose how they identified their primary studies, and only 10 studies are included in the survey.
