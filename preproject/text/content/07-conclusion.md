# Conclusion

In this systematic literature review, we have examined both machine learning approaches for ISA classification and convolutional neural network approaches for binary code analysis. Our analysis indicates that while current machine learning methods achieve high accuracy in classifying known instruction set architectures, they heavily rely on manually engineered features and often require binary file header information. The current byte-level feature extraction techniques show limitations when distinguishing between similar architectures or when handling full binaries with non-code sections left intact. Looking forward, we identify significant potential in employing deep learning approaches, particularly CNN, for discovering ISA information in binary code. The success of CNN in malware classification, achieving accuracies above 99% without requiring manual feature engineering, suggests promising applications for ISA detection and feature extraction. However, realizing this potential will require addressing key challenges, including the development of architecture-agnostic methods capable of identifying specific ISA features rather than just classifying known architectures, and reducing reliance on binary format metadata. Future research should focus on leveraging CNN's automatic feature learning capabilities, while incorporating the lessons learned from traditional machine learning approaches in this domain.
